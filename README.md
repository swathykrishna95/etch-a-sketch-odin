# etch-a-sketch-odin

This is an approximation of how an etch-a-sketch would work as a webpage. The colours are filled into the divs when the mouse hovers over them. The divs are generated using a nested for loop. It starts with 16 as a base row and column number. There is a button to change that nukmber, which creates a new page with a custom number of div rows and columns. The filled color changes as it is generated by a random function. Credits to the random function due to assembly_wizard of Stack Overflow.
